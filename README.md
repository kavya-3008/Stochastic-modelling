# Stochastic Modeling of Stock Data

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and modeling stock price movements using stochastic processes. The notebook applies various financial models and statistical techniques to simulate stock prices and assess their behavior under different conditions. The focus is on understanding random processes, such as **Markov Chains** and **Monte Carlo simulations**, and how they apply to stock market data.

## Features

- Stock price simulations using stochastic processes
- Monte Carlo simulations for future stock price predictions
- Markov Chain modeling of stock movements

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells.
